I ordered the turntable in white resin and the button pushers in aluminum.\nThe parts arrived yesterday, and the difference is night and day. I attached them to our contraption, and sure enough, the aluminum pushers fit the servos perfectly and handled the pressure without breaking. They effectively saved my otherwise dead project.\nA big shout out to PCBWay for sponsoring this post.
