But before we get into that let me tell you who i am!\nI\u0026rsquo;m Chris, a mostly self-learned developer from the Netherlands. I\u0026rsquo;m still in high-school and have followed a computer science class for about 2 years now. My dad is a data analyst and has made a huge home lab (which i recently started putting my own stuff in to) and is also the person that really got me into developing, he also has a really nice blog also hosted on Hugo at spithout.net if you want to check it out.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll mostly be documenting on my computer science projects and what i learn from them, UX principles for example with my current computer science assignment. I\u0026rsquo;ll also be documenting personal projects and how i set them up and how you can too!\nThanks for reading one of many posts i\u0026rsquo;ll be making here!\nCheck out my github repo\u0026rsquo;s at github.com/boreddevnl!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/firstpost/","summary":"This is a blog i\u0026rsquo;ll be using to document my coding journey.
