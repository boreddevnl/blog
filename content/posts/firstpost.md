This is a blog i'll be using to document my coding journey. But before we get into that let me tell you who i am!

I'm Chris, a mostly self-learned developer from the Netherlands. I'm still in high-school and have followed a computer
science class for about 2 years now. My dad is a data analyst and has made a huge home lab (which i recently started putting my own stuff in to)
and is also the person that really got me into developing, he also has a really nice blog also hosted on Hugo at [spithout.net](https://spithout.net) if you want to check it out. 

I'll mostly be documenting on my computer science projects and what i learn from them, UX principles for example with my current computer science assignment. I'll also be documenting personal projects and how i set them up and how you can too!

Thanks for reading one of many posts i'll be making here!
